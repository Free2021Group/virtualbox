  <title>Virtualbox OSE for Debian</title>
  <section>
    <title>Different versions</title>
    <para>
      The Open Source Edition of VirtualBox contains most but not all
      features of the closed-source VirtualBox product that is
      distributed under different terms and available from the
      <ulink url="http://virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads"> Virtualbox
      homepage</ulink>. Missing are:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Remote Display Protocol (RDP) Server
        </para>
        <para>
          This component implements a complete RDP server on top of
          the virtual hardware and allows users to connect to a
          virtual machine remotely using any RDP compatible client.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>USB support</para>
        <para>
          VirtualBox implements a virtual USB controller and supports
          passing through USB 1.1 and USB 2.0 devices to virtual
          machines.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>USB over RDP</para>
        <para>
          This is a combination of the RDP server and USB support
          allowing users to make USB devices available to virtual
          machines running remotely.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>iSCSI initiator</para>
        <para>
          VirtualBox contains a builtin iSCSI initiator making it
          possible to use iSCSI targets as virtual disks without the
          guest requiring support for iSCSI.
        </para>

  <section>
    <title>64-bit guests</title>
      Starting with version 2.0.0 VirtualBox also supports 64-bit guest operating systems,
      under the following conditions:
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    You need a 64-bit processor with hardware virtualization support
	    and a 64-bit host operating system.
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    You must run a 64-bit version of VirtualBox on that OS. This can
	    then run both 32-bit and 64-bit VMs; a 32-bit VirtualBox can only run 32-bit
	    VMs, regardless of the hardware.
	  </listitem>
          <listitem>
	    You must enable hardware virtualization; software virtualization is not supported
	    for 64-bit VMs.
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	There is no specific setting to enable 64-bit support for a guest.
	However, you should enable the I/O APIC for virtual machines that you intend to
	use in 64-bit mode.

    <title>How to provide networking to virtual machines</title>
    <section>
      <title>Mechanism</title>
      <para>
	VirtualBox can use three alternative mechanisms to provide
	Ethernet networking to its virtual machines:b
      </para>
      <section>
	<title>NAT</title>
	<para>
	  This is the easiest to use type of setup: The virtual
	  ethernet interface is connected to a virtual NAT router
	  including a DHCP server that is implemented within
	  the VirtualBox host software.
	</para>
	<para>
	  This is the default mode. It usually does not require
	  any extra configuration on the host.
	</para>
      </section>
      <section>
	<title>Internal network</title>
	<para>
	  In this mode, there is only connectivity within an
	  emulated network shared between two or more virtual
	  machines running in the same VirtualBox instance.
	</para>
      </section>
      <section>
	<title>Host interface</title>
	<para>
	  The virtual ethernet interface is connected to a
	  real device on the host filtering out its traffic.
	</para>
      </section>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Incompatibilities</title>
    <para>
      Unfortunately, the configuration files between version version
      1.4.0-svn4130 and 1.5.0 the configuration files are
      incompatible. In order to fix this issue please delete the
      complete <command><![CDATA[<Uart>]]></command> section in any
      <filename>~/.VirtualBox/Machines/NAME/NAME.xml</filename> files.
    </para>
    <para>
      When upgrading from a pre 2.0.0 version to virtualbox might complaing
      about a missing format attribute in the HardDisk tag of
      <filename>~/.VirtualBox/VirtualBox.xml</filename>. Manually adding
      'format="vdi"' solves this.
    </para>
    <para>
      A bug appeared in in kernel 2.6.29 RC5 that broke virtualbox-ose. The fix
      was added in 2.6.29.1. If you happen to use 2.6.29 and epxerience
      problems starting your VMs please upgrade. In Debian all
      linux-image-2.6.29 versions starting with Debian version 2.6.29-2 are
      fine.
