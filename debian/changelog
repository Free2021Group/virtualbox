virtualbox-ose (1.5.4-dfsg-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Michael Meskes ]
  * Do not build guest-utils on amd64 because 64bit guests are nor support
    yet.
  * Removed build time dependency on i32-libs that is not really needed.
  * New upstream version.
  * Removed some new files because of licensing problems:
    ./src/VBox/Additions/linux/selinux-fedora 
    ./src/VBox/Additions/linux/xmouse/Imakefile
    ./src/VBox/HostServices/SharedClipboard/linux-stub.cpp
  * Removed the following patches because they are not needed anymore:
    01-configure.dpatch
    08-no-kernel.dpatch
    09-fix-initscript.dpatch
    12-kcompat-2.6.24.dpatch

virtualbox-ose (1.5.2-dfsg2-7) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Patrick Winnertz ]
  * Do only recommend the virtualbox-ose-modules package. Maybe someone
    would like to compile it on it's own, or not with m-a. (Closes: #456989)

  [ Hilko Bengen ]
  * Build system: a large move towards using dh_install
    - This requires that we force the build output dir to a fixed location.
    - The dh_install call needs to go to the `install' target.
  * Leave out code/data for test cases from virtualbox-ose binary package

  [ Michael Meskes ]
  * Only suggest guest-sources in guest-utils. With l-m-e expected to include
    the guest-modules in the near future, this should be sufficient.
  * Rearranged parts of the debian dir.
  * Replaced our patch to not need kernel sources by new configure option
    taken from svn.

  [ Daniel Baumann ]
  * Bumping policy also in module controls, no other changes needed.

  * Add 2.6.24 compatibility fix (Closes: #456464)

  [ Patrick Winnertz ]
  * Moved initscript again out of debian, we should use the upstream one
    and created a patch for this one. (in order to fix lintian warning)
  * Add description to 02-host-module.dpatch
