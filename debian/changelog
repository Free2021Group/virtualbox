virtualbox-ose (1.5.0-dfsg2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Patrick Winnertz ]
  * Added README.Debian to virtualbox-ose in order to document that the
    configuration xml files of the machines are not compatible between
    1.4.0-svn4130 and the 1.5.0 release. (Closes: #441634)
  * Build only binary-dep packages in binary-dep target and only binary-indep
    packages in binary-indep target.
  * Added postrm to virtualbox-ose in order to remove the vboxusers group on
    purge. (Closes: #442396)

  [ Michael Meskes ]
  * Force udev to reload the rules in postinst. Hopefully this makes sure that
    the device always belongs to the right group.

virtualbox-ose (1.4.0svn4130-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Patrick Winnertz ]
  * Rename virtualbox to virtualbox-ose since innotek has a trademark on this

    See http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Licensing_FAQ point 8 for details.
  * If module is not loadable on this kernel don't fail to install kernel
    module. (Closes: #440509)
  * Adjusted Upstream Authors name. The name of the company has changed.
  * Adjusted copyright. virtualbox is GPLv2 *only*.

  [ Michael Meskes ]
  * Added Build-Dependancy to g++-multilib on amd64.

  [ Daniel Baumann ]
  * Initial release (Closes: #406992, #407001, #409711).

  [ Philipp Hug ]
  * Stripped kbuild and yasm from source tarball
  * Use Debian's kbuild and yasm instead

  * Build against correct kernel source
  * Integrated changes by Patrick Winnertz
  * clean: rm env.sh AutoConfig.kmk configure.log
  * Install udev rules to automatically create device
  * Automatically create vboxusers group
  * Binary names are now lowercase
  * Disabled stripping for VMM because it breaks VirtualBox

  [ Patrick Winnertz ]
  * Remove Microsoft license stuff from orig.tar.gz (repackaged it )
    See dfsg-free section in debian/rules for details.
  * Added patch to use own yasm
  * Added patch to remove Additions from the Makefile.kmk

    Therefore I removed the patch, too.
  * Don't call dh_installdeb twice.  (build-dep & build-indep)
  * Added section to create dfsg tarball automatically to debian/rules (experimental!!)
  * Added lintian.overrides for -fPIC since somehow virtualbox doesn't work with

  * Corrected .desktop file
