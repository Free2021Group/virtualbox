virtualbox-ose (1.4.0svn4130-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Patrick Winnertz ]
  * Rename virtualbox to virtualbox-ose since innotek has a trademark on this
    name and they prohibit us to use this name together with the open-source edition.
    See http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Licensing_FAQ point 8 for details.
  * If module is not loadable on this kernel don't fail to install kernel
    module. (Closes: #440509)
  * Adjusted Upstream Authors name. The name of the company has changed.
  * Adjusted copyright. virtualbox is GPLv2 *only*.

  [ Michael Meskes ]
  * Added Build-Dependancy to g++-multilib on amd64.

virtualbox (1.4.0svn4130-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Daniel Baumann ]
  * Initial release (Closes: #406992, #407001, #409711).
  
  [ Philipp Hug ]
  * Stripped kbuild and yasm from source tarball
  * Use Debian's kbuild and yasm instead
  * Added myself as uploader
  * Build target for module is now all instead of module
  * Build against correct kernel source
  * Integrated changes by Patrick Winnertz
  * clean: rm env.sh AutoConfig.kmk configure.log
  * Install udev rules to automatically create device
  * Automatically create vboxusers group
  * Binary names are now lowercase
  * Disabled stripping for VMM because it breaks VirtualBox
  * Don't require kernel module, recommend it instead

  [ Patrick Winnertz ]
  * Remove Microsoft license stuff from orig.tar.gz (repackaged it )
    See dfsg-free section in debian/rules for details.
  * Added patch to use own yasm
  * Added patch to remove Additions from the Makefile.kmk
  * Remove ./src/libs/xpcom18a4/nsprpub/build/autoconf from source tarball.
  * Doesn't depend on gcc-3.4 and g++-3.4 since they are going to be removed from
    debian. Use default instead.
    Therefore I removed the patch, too.
  * Don't call dh_installdeb twice.  (build-dep & build-indep)
  * Added section to create dfsg tarball automatically to debian/rules (experimental!!)
  * Added lintian.overrides for -fPIC since somehow virtualbox doesn't work with
  * Added patch to prevent building modules and kernel code when building the
    gui.
  * Install udev rule with virtualbox and not with the module, since several
    modules for several kernels could be there.
  * Improved copyright statements in copyright file.
  * Corrected .desktop file
