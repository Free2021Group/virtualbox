_Description: Proceed with virtualbox-ose upgrade despite losing snapshots?
 You are currently upgrading virtualbox-ose to a new upstream version. All
 snapshots will be discarded by this upgrade, because snapshots are version
 specific. Please select 'no' if you want to merge snapshot data into the base image first.
