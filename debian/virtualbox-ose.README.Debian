virtualbox-ose for Debian
-------------------------

A bug appeared in in kernel 2.6.29 RC5 that broke virtualbox-ose. The fix was
added in 2.6.29.1. If you happen to use 2.6.29 and epxerience problems starting
your VMs please upgrade. In Debian all linux-image-2.6.29 versions starting
with Debian version 2.6.29-2 are fine.
